Feature: Add locations to the system
  As the inventory manager
  I want to add locations to the system,
  So that I can track where the team items are.

  * A location should contain:
   - A descriptive label (e.g. "Adam's Parents house")
   - An address (e.g. "42 Wheeler Avenue, HP10 8EB")
   - A location type:
      - player
      - team storage
      - transit
