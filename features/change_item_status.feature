Feature: Change the status of an item
  As an inventory manager,
  In order to keep an up-to-date view of the state of the team kit
  I want to change status of an item 

  * An item can have the following statuses:
    * ordered
    * in storage
    * in transit
    * with a player
    * needs setup
    * needs repair
    * lost
    * unrepairable
    * stolen
